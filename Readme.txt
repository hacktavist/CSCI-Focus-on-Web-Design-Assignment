Part A:
My three main colors for this scheme are:
- #E77DB9: light pink;
- #FF8A8A: peachy pink variant;
- #FFBF8A: light brown tone reminiscent of waffle cones
- #000000: black for text

Part B:
My process for selecting colors came from looking at some of the less prominent color psychology; mainly that the color pink is also associated with sweets. Pink reminds me of ice cream due to some advertising I have seen as a child, and a quick google image search showed that most ice cream web pages are pink. 
I used paletton.com for choosing a base color and tweaking the other colors to it
